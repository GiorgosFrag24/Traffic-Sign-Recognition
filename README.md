# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Traffic Sign Recognition using the GTSRB dataset.
The goal here was to develop a simple CNN model which achieves an accuracy score of over 80% on the test dataset.
After that, we apply gaussian noise to the testing images, which decreases overall accuracy significantly. 
In order to mend that, we apply a denoising operator as a preprocessing step.
